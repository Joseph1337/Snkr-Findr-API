# üëüSNKR FINDRüîé
A REST API created for sneakerheads.
The ***SNKR FINDR*** API allows the user to obtain essential information on sneakers including:

- Sneaker Name
- Colorway
- Product ID
- Retail Price
- Image URL
- Release Date
- Price map of each corresponding size

## Getting Started
In order to make requests to the API, we will be using the [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library.

1. Begin by installing the library. Navigate to your project directory in terminal and type: 
```
pip install requests
```

2. Once the Requests library has been installed, make sure to import it in your project:
```Python 
import requests
```

3. You're all set to start using the SNKR FINDR API üëç

## HTTP Requests
Now that you have the requests library installed, it's time to make some API requests.

**Example:**
```Python
import requests

#get the trending sneakers
popularSneakers = requests.get(https://snkr-findr.herokuapp.com/sneakers)

#get sneaker using product id (sneaker_id)
sneaker = requests.get(https://snkr-findr.herokuapp.com/sneakers/<sneaker_id>

#get sneaker(s) using search
searchSneaker = requests.get(https://snkr findr.herokuapp.com/sneakers/search/<keyword>
```

**Sample JSON Response**:
