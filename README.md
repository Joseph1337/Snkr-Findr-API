# SNKR TRAKRðŸ‘Ÿ
A REST API created for sneakerheads.

The **SNKR TRAKR** API allows the user to obtain essential information on sneakers including:
- Sneaker Name
- Colorway
- Product ID
- Retail Price
- Image Links
- Release Date
- Price map of each corresponding size

Currently the API is only able to collect information from [GOAT](goat.com) but the end goal is to obtain sneaker data from [StockX](https://stockx.com/), [Stadium Goods](https://www.stadiumgoods.com/), [Flight Club](https://www.flightclub.com/) and other Foot sites.
